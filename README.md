### VNyan users: Consider using my [TriggerAPI](https://github.com/LumKitty/VNyan-TriggerAPI) utility instead. It's more powerful *and* easier to use!

# SendWebSocket

A trivial Websocket client.

Written for a simple usecase. I wanted to send WebSocket messages from MixItUp to VNyan but MixItUp doesn't support this. Maybe it will be useful to you too IDK ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Usage:
SendWebSocket.exe ws://localhost:8000/vnyan Message Parameter
